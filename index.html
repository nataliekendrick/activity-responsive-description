    <h1>The first thing I saw when picking an object was my <span class="candle">candle</span> on my 
      desk. I would describe the function of the <span class="candle">candle</span> as a way to 
      enhance our sense of smell when entering a room. My <span class="candle">candle</span> has 
      a vanilla praline pumpkin scent. The <span class="candle">candle</span> consists of having a 
      waxy texture which is covered by a hollow heat-proof glass. In the 
      center of the wax, there is a <span class="candlewick">candlewick</span>. The <span class="candlewick">candlewick</span> is meant 
      to be lit by <span class="fire">fire</span> as it will provide the scent of the <span class="candle">candle</span> to spread. </h1>
